## Running the examples

- Each example is split into different modules (e.g. user)
- Each example runs a specified method in the module (e.g. login)

Before running any examples you have to install dependencies using poetry:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

To run an example use the ```poetry run``` command:

```bash
$ poetry run python -m examples.<MODULE>.<METHOD> [args]
```

To get help on the arguments run the command with the ``--help`` flag.
